%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am contacting you with regard to the internship opportunity you advertised for
Linux driver development. I am a Masters student in the Computer Science program
at Portland State University. I have extensive experience with C programming and
low-level programming on Linux, and I am enthusiastic about Linux driver
development. I believe this would make me a good match for this internship.

I have a great deal of experience programming in C. In addition to course work
and extra-curricular projects, I worked for two years as a CS tutor at Portland
State University, debugging students' C code and teaching them C-programming
concepts. I have also worked as a teaching assistant in an operating systems
class, teaching students about the algorithmic and practical components of
kernel programming in a Linux environment. In addition, I have worked for the
last year as a research assitant helping to design and evaluate algorithms to
improve the performance of systems software.

Although I have not participated in driver development, I am familiar with the
Linux kernel API from coursework and personal projects, including having used
`linux/module.h`, and I am enthusiastic about device drivers and low-level
programming. Additionally, I believe my knowledge of operating systems concepts
will carry over well into the domain of device drivers.

I believe that my experience with operating systems and with low-level
programming in C -- in addition to my enthusiasm for the topic -- make me well
suited to this internship. I look forward to meeting with you to discuss the
position further. I can be contacted by e-mail at
\href{mailto:hamlinb@cs.pdx.edu}{hamlinb@cs.pdx.edu} or by phone at
(971) 732-6850. I appreciate your time and consideration.
