%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am interested in the graduate SDN/NFV intern position at Intel. I'm a Masters
student of computer science Portland State University with a background in
networking and systems programming in C in a Linux environment. I'm enthusiastic
about the topic of software defined networking and network virtualization, and I
believe my experience and enthusiasm would make me a good fit to intern at your
company.

I have extensive experience working in C in a Linux environment -- from being a
teaching assistant for an operating systems class to modifying open-source C
projects as a research assistant. I have also done coursework and research on
the subject of network routing protocols, and I have a strong proficiency in
this area. I have experience programming in a virtualized environment through
coursework, and although I do not have work experience working on SDN or NFV
software specifically, I have some familiarity with these topics, and I would be
eager to learn more. Additionally, I have some experience with NFV concepts from
helping to set up and maintain an OpenStack cluster when working at the PSU
Computer Action Team.

I feel that my background in networking and C programming in a Linux
environment, as well as my interest in SDN and NFV  would make me well suited to
intern at Intel. I look forward to the prospect of meeting with you to discuss
the position further. I can be contacted by e-mail at
\href{mailto:hamlinb@cs.pdx.edu}{hamlinb@cs.pdx.edu} or by phone at
(971) 732-6850. I appreciate your time and consideration.
