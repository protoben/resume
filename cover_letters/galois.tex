%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am interested in interning at Galois. I'm a graduate student of computer
science Portland State University with a background and a lot of interest
in cryptography, security, networking, and low-level systems programming. I'm
also enthusiastic about the topic of formal verification of protocols and
software. I believe my experience and enthusiasm would make me a good fit to
intern at your company.

My interest in your company was piqued by a talk on Cryptol by Aaron Tomb that I
attended at Portland State University. I have some background in cryptography
from a complexity theoretic perspective through course work I've done. I also
have some background in the security side of things -- in addition the classes
I've taken in it, I have a weekly reading group with the security professor and
the multimedia networking professor at PSU on cryptography and security for
multimedia systems. My research endeavors have included securing network coding
for wireless communications and format-preserving cryptography for images and
video. My experience also extends to low-level programming in C and assembly,
including having been a teaching assistant in an operating systems class.
Although I have less experience in formal verification of programs, I have done
course work on it, and I'm excited to learn more. I'm also an avid user of
Haskell and Git.

I feel that my background in networking, cryptography, and security, and my
interest in formal verification would make me well suited to intern at Galois. I
look forward to the prospect of meeting with you to discuss the position
further. I can be contacted by e-mail at
\href{mailto:hamlinb@cs.pdx.edu}{hamlinb@cs.pdx.edu} or by phone at
(971) 732-6850. I appreciate your time and consideration.
