Background
----------

I am a network and systems programmer. My interests are focused on networking,
coding theory, cryptography, and packet radio. I'm happiest when the project I'm
working on involves putting theory into practice.

I've worked as a network administrator and a Unix system administrator. For the
last two years I've worked for the Portland State University Computer Science
Tutors, helping people understand aspects of computer science from systems
programming, to computational theory, to data structures and software
engineering.
